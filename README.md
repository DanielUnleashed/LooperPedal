# LooperPedal

The Stargaze Looper pedal was my final effort to get out of college and it paid out because I got off with merits! I can only share the code because the paper is now property of the University of MÃ¡laga and I ussed this repository to share the code.

This is a design based on an ESP32. Using **FreeRTOS** and both the kernels of the microcontroller I was able to playback CD quality audio at 44.1 kHz and also record it to an SD. This has the basic functionalities of a Looper pedal, it will play recorded segments on a loop whilst recording new takes above the pre recorded fragments. You can delete previous recorded fragments. I also added it a pretty neat visual interface that could do some 3D shenanigans.
